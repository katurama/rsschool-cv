### About me
I was a co-owner of one small shop in Belarus, which worked with various design projects. Thanks to this experience I can say that I can quickly adapt to situations, I am communicable, I can get along with completely different people, it can be a plus in working with a team, I'm stress-resistant and I'm able to manage a large flow of tasks at the same time. And I love and know how to learn.
